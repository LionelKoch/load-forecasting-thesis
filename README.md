Description of Components
/data

This directory contains all the data used in the project.

raw_stations/: Contains the raw, unprocessed temperature and humidity data files from individual German weather stations.

Germany_average_temperature_humidity_2022_2024.csv: The processed and aggregated weather data, used as exogenous features in the models. Generated by 01_weather_processing.ipynb.

updated_load_data_with_german_holidays.csv: The final, clean time series data for actual electricity load, merged with calendar features and German holidays. This is the primary input for the forecasting models. Generated by 03_add_calendar_features_and_holidays.ipynb.

/notebooks

This directory holds the Jupyter Notebooks containing all the code for data processing, modeling, and visualization. The files should be run in the specific sequence outlined in the 'Execution Order' section below to ensure dependencies are handled correctly.

01_weather_processing.ipynb: Processes the raw data from /data/raw_stations into the final aggregated weather file.

02_load_data_collection.ipynb: Collects and performs initial cleaning on the electricity load data.

03_add_calendar_features_and_holidays.ipynb: Adds calendar features (e.g., day of the week) and German public holidays to the load data.

04_final_experiments.ipynb: The core modeling notebook. It runs the SARIMAX and TimeGPT models with different feature sets (Load-Only, Load+Weekend, Full Exog) across all seasonal anchors and forecast horizons. It generates the detailed summary tables in /appendix/tables.

/Visualizations/Main Results and Final Figure Generation.ipynb: Synthesizes the summary tables from the experiments to produce the final figures (e.g., performance comparisons, runtime analysis) for the main body of the thesis.

/Visualizations/Model Diagnostics and Visualization Notebook.ipynb: Performs in-depth diagnostic analysis on model residuals (ACF, PACF, distribution plots) to validate model performance. The outputs are intended for the thesis appendix.

/appendix

This directory contains the final outputs (figures and tables) that are referenced in the thesis appendix.

/figures: Contains all plots generated by the visualization notebooks, organized into subdirectories based on their content (e.g., residuals, forecast plots).

/tables: Contains all the summary CSV files with the performance metrics (MAE, RMSE, MASE) for every model run. These are the direct output of 04_final_experiments.ipynb.

How to Run the Project
To reproduce the results of this thesis, follow the steps below.

1. Setup

First, clone the repository and install the required Python libraries from the requirements.txt file.

git clone <repository-url>
cd load-forecasting-thesis
pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Execution Order

The notebooks in the /notebooks directory should be run in the following sequence, as they have dependencies on each other's outputs:

01_weather_processing.ipynb - To get the processed weather data.

02_load_data_collection.ipynb - To get the base load data.

03_add_calendar_features_and_holidays.ipynb - To create the final feature-rich dataset.

04_final_experiments.ipynb - To run all model experiments and generate the result tables in /appendix/tables.

/Visualizations/Main Results and Final Figure Generation.ipynb - To generate the primary figures for the thesis.

/Visualizations/Model Diagnostics and Visualization Notebook.ipynb - To generate the diagnostic plots for the appendix.

The /appendix folder contains the final outputs. Running the notebooks as described will regenerate these files, ensuring the project's results can be fully reproduced.
